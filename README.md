# Skyrim-potion-recipe-generator
Just for fun.

Upcoming features:
Quickly enter in which ingredients your Skyrim character is carrying and how many and:
1. Get a list of every valid combination of ingredients and the type of potion each combination should create. 
2. Select which potion effects (including sell value) are most important to you in order from most to least critical. Receive an output which informs you which ingredients should be combined and in what order so that you get the optimal results for your request. Example, "I'm carrying 5 Bristlewort, 15 Snowberries, and 29 Hagraven Claws. I want 4 healing potions, 12 magicka potions, and afterwards I want to just make whatever potions sell best for vendoring later."
