# Skyrim-potion-recipe-generator
Just for fun.

Anticipated usage case(s):
1. Quickly enter in which ingredients your Skyrim character is carrying and how many, select which potion effects (or just gold) are most important to you in ranked order, and printout a recipe display on which ingredients should be combined and in which order so that you get the optimal results. Example, "I'm carrying 5 Bristlewort, 15 Snowberries, and 29 Hagraven Claws. I want 4 healing potions, 12 magicka potions, and afterwards I want to just make whatever potions sell best for vendoring later."
